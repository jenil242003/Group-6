# Income Prediction and Flower Species Prediction Projects

## Income Prediction Project

### Description

The Income Prediction Project aims to predict whether an individual's income will be above or below $50,000 based on various input features. 

The project consists of a Flask web application that integrates a machine learning model trained on the Adult dataset. Users can interact with the application by providing input data, and the model predicts their income level.

Through this project, I learned about building machine learning models, integrating them into web applications using Flask, and working with SQLite databases to store and retrieve data.

## Flower Species Prediction Project

### Description

The Flower Species Prediction Project aims to predict the species of a flower based on its characteristics. The motivation behind this project is to provide a simple and interactive platform for learning about different flower species and machine learning techniques.

The project consists of a Flask web application that integrates a machine learning model trained on the Iris dataset. Users can input the characteristics of a flower, and the model predicts the species.

Through this project, I learned about machine learning algorithms, Flask web development, and integrating models into web applications.

## Income Prediction Installation

1. We have ensure you have Python and Flask installed.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
5. Access the application through your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Income Prediction Usage

- Visit the home page (`http://localhost:5000`) to interact with the Income Prediction application.
- Enter the required input features and submit the form to get the income prediction result.
- Explore the about page (`http://localhost:5000/about`) for more information about the project.
- View the stored data from the dataset on the data page (`http://localhost:5000/data`).
